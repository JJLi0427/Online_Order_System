# Online Order System

The project is an online ordering system for a restaurant. Customers can log in by entering their mobile number, table number, and the number of diners, choose the quantity of different dishes from the menu, and place an order after filling in their taste preferences. The system includes backend management. Backend users are divided into employees and shop owners. Employees can only track and modify the order status in the backend, while shop owners can modify the menu, employee list, order list, etc.

## Project Display

The project has designed different user interfaces and entrances for users, administrators, and employees, corresponding to different functions

## Frameworks Used

The project uses the following key frameworks:

* Spring: Provides the foundational support for developing Java applications.
* Spring MVC: Used for building web applications.
* MyBatis: Used for persistence and database operations.
Logback: Used for logging application events.

## Project Structure

The project follows a typical Maven project structure:

### File tree

```bash
.
├─src
│  └─main
│      ├─java
│      │  └─com
│      │      └─ljj
│      │          ├─controller
│      │          ├─mapper
│      │          ├─pojo
│      │          └─service

│      └─webapp
│          └─WEB-INF
│              └─jsp
└─pom.xml
```

* `src/main/java`: This is where the Java source files reside.  
* `src/main/resources`: This directory contains resources such as XML and properties files.  
* `src/main/webapp`: This directory contains web application resources.  
* `target`: This directory is generated by Maven and contains the compiled classes and packaged application.  

### Key Configuration Files

* `pom.xml`: This is the project's Maven configuration file. It includes the project dependencies, plugins, and build settings.  
* `applicationContext.xml`: This file contains Spring's application context configuration.  
* `database.properties`: This file contains the database connection properties.  
* `logback.xml`: This file contains the configuration for Logback, the logging framework used in the project.  
* `mybatis-config.xml`: This file contains the configuration for MyBatis, the persistence framework used in the project.  
* `springmvc-config.xml`: This file contains the configuration for Spring MVC, the web framework used in the project.  

## How to Use

### Check your Configuration

1. Use `mysqltables.sql` to build your database tables.
2. Check `database.properties`, change your database url, user and password.

### Build and Package

To compile and package the project, use the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

This will create a WAR file in the target directory.

### Deployment

* To deploy the application on Tomcat:

  1. Copy the generated WAR file from the target directory to the webapps directory of your Tomcat installation.
  2. Start Tomcat by running the startup.sh (or startup.bat on Windows) script in the bin directory of your Tomcat installation.
  3. The application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8080/ordersystem`, assuming Tomcat is running on localhost and port 8080.

* Use docker image to deploy

  You can use `dockerfile` to build your image and deploly it through docker on your 8080 port.
  ```bash
  cd ./src
  docker build -t ordersystem .
  docker run -p 8080:8080 ordersystem
  ```

* WEB Proxy

  Proxy projects through Apache: Install Apache in your web server and write a proxy file like sample in `proxy.conf` file name is your server domain or ip.

## Project TODO

* -[x] Add staff change password function
* -[x] User order page can see history order
